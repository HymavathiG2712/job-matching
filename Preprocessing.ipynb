figured out how to pass a long .net datatable to a stored procedure with a sql server user defined table type parameter. ? created the .net template class hierarchy for the json structures so that each json file can be de-serialized into the class hierarchy via one vb.net statement.  created new json schema files and .net code to validate the json data. c#, sql server developer weyandt, llc october 2016 to december 2016 120 hours total)  i created a c#, \"csv -> sqlserver transformer\", with a wcf service library that can service windows or web forms.  let's say a person, can \"design/specify a data warehouse\", by simply exporting a group of \"views as csv\", into one file folder:  big picture: my automation automatically creates the data warehouse & transforms and transports the data from the csv folder shown above.  details: my automation can allow a user to create and point to database schemas where the csv data will be transformed and transported.  my \"schema-table focused\" stored procedures do all of the database work, except for the dynamic create table sql building, easier to debug in c#.  my automation loops thru the csv folder, with csv files as shown above to  compress all (e.g, timedetail files shown above) data into one database table  dump each file's csv data into a dynamically created, matching, temporary, all varchar, temp table in sql server  automatically scan all the data rows to automatically determine the non-varchar columns, i.e. bit, int, long, float, date, etc.  dynamically build & execute create table sql to create each typed database table like this:   dynamically build and execute insert into select statements to transform and transport the csv data into the typed tables with try_cast columns like this: c#, intersystems cache database & ssrs developer radius global solutions - ambler, pa april 2016 to june 2016 created two, new ssrs reports and associated sql that 1. odbc connect to intersystems cache databases used by artiva crm. with multiple parameters via hardwired or database driven values. 2. deliver default and multi-selectable, visible or not, report columns:  created a new c# console application framework with reusable classes and interfaces that performs four major functions: 1. creates an html formatted smtp email report from a combination of windows folder disk statistics, and a stats file downloaded from linux. 2. creates an email report from an ado.net datatable converted to csv and attached to the email. 3. reads an excel xlsx file into ado.net datatables converted to multiple csvs attached to the email. 4. downloads 3 large zipped files from linux, unzips the files, parses files into multiple files for different record types and chunks large files into smaller files based on configurable file sizes and record counts, and uploads the small files to linux. sql server, oracle, vertica, python developer highpoint solutions - east norriton, pa july 2015 to january 2016 i re-engineered the highpoint solutions databurst data warehousing software product into python to fit into teva pharmaceutical's vertica database environment.  from scratch, i wrote all of the python to meet the vertica needs.  copied ddl & data to oracle & sql server as a python product line for future vertica, oracle, sql server databurst clients on linux/windows.  designed, refactored & created new python & sql components: ?
